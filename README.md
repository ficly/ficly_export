# The Ficly Export Project

This won't do you much good if you don't have the data, but this is my attempt to turn Ficly into a static export.  I ended up building a Rails app and then writing a bunch of rake tasks and and after_action filter to just dump out all the files as cleanly as possible.

It took too long, but it works.

I'll be putting the sql export up at some point so you can play with this yourself, and maybe make it prettier, more responsive, etc.
